        <td><p>Amela Subašić is a Canadian - Bosnian born artist. She was born and raised in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. As a child she admired her father's drawings; he was an architect with good drawing skills, and it was he who inspired and encouraged her to draw and paint from an early age. Her mother was a literacy professor and she gave Amela her love for books and reading.</p> <br>

<p >Amela graduated from Sarajevo High School of Applied Arts and Academy of Fine Arts of the University of Sarajevo (B.F.A.), majoring in painting.</p> <br>

<p >In 1992 Bosnia and Herzegovina was attacked and her hometown Sarajevo was besieged by the Serb army. Along with her sister and brother, Amela escaped from their apartment on Grbavica, which was in an occupied part of the city by the Serb forces until the end of the war. Her mother decided to stay in the apartment all by herself with the belief that she would be safe and only her children would be in danger (Amela's father passed away one year prior to the war). Shortly after their escape from Grbavica her mother was taken and brutally murdered by the Serb army.</p> <br>

<p >For almost four years Amela lived as a refugee in her own city, hoping that her mother was still alive and dreaming of the reunion that would come one day. During these war years she witnessed brutal destruction, madness, and violence against civilians and humanity, yet the rest of the world kept quiet. As a witness and victim of war and violence she uses art to spread the word and as a weapon against that madness. </p> <br>
            
<p >The remains of her mother's body were found through DNA analysis after having been missing for 23 years.</p> <br>
            
<p>In 2000 (four years after the war was over) she decided to move from her country to Belgium. After living there for a few years she immigrated to Canada. Currently she lives in Vancouver, BC, with her family. </p> </td>
